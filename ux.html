            To deepen my understanding of users interactions with interfaces I studied how they interact with the charging station in the science library (sci li) at Brown University.

                <ul>
                    <li>Very quick interaction with interface - enter pin in as fast as possible and approach with device in hand</li>
                    <li>When retreiving device almost always correctly enter pin on the first try</li>
                    <li>Choose the highest open port on the charging station</li>
                    <li>Do not leave device in charging station for very long</li>
                    <li>Normally use charging station for phone, but a couple people used it for airpods</li>

                    <li>
                        Generally do not, it's only four digits, easy to memorize
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>How often do you use the charging station?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                       Very rarely, normally bring a charger from dorm
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <li>Do you think the charging station needs to lock?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                       Mixed answers, some were adament about locking the charging station, others argued it isn't necessary
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <li>Should the charging station be expanded to support laptop charging?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                       This is unnecessary, you need your laptop to do work
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <li>Do you know what to do if you forget your pin?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                       Mentioned seeing a help button in the interface, but not sure what the next steps would be
